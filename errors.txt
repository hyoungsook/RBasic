10\. Notice that the approximation calculated in question *two* is very close to the exact calculation in the first question. Now perform the same task for more extreme values. Compare the exact calculation and the normal approximation for the interval (79,81]. How many times bigger is the actual proportion than the approximation?

Two should be nine

15. In answering the previous questions, we found that it is not at all rare for a seven footer to become an NBA player. What would be a fair critique of our calculations:
a. Practice and talent are what make a great basketball player, not height.
b. The normal approximation is not appropriate for heights.
c. As seen in question 3, the normal approximation tends to underestimate the extreme values. It’s possible that there are more seven footers than we predicted.
d. As seen in question 3, the normal approximation tends to overestimate the extreme
values. It’s possible that there are fewer seven footers than we predicted.

Question 3 should be question 10

So does this mean that if we go and hire low salary players with many BB, and who therefore increase the number of walks per game by 2, our team will score 4.2 more runs per game?

Should be (4.2 is now 1.5)

The make_date function can be used to quickly create a date object. It takes three ar- guments: year, month, day, hour, minute, seconds, and time zone defaulting to the epoch values on UTC time. So create an date object representing, for example, July 6, 2019 we write:

 make_date(1970, 7, 6) 
#> [1] "1970-07-06"

Should be 

 make_date(2019, 7, 6) 
#> [1] "2019-07-06"

"It turns them into days since the epoch.The as.Date function can convert a character into a date. So to see that the epoch is day 0 we can type"

There should be a space between "epoch" and "The".
